# Face-Landmarks-Recognition
Face landmark recognition using PyTorch is used in computer vision and image processing to locate specific facial features, such as the eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline. This technique can be used for a variety of applications, including facial recognition, emotion detection, and head pose estimation.
